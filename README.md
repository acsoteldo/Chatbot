# Emergency Chatbot

__For future reference, please note this is a simulation.__

Implemented in Python, this is a messaging application that performs live chat functions in response to real-time user interactions during natural disasters. This is a simple rule-based chatbot.
Might expand to other languages for a more inclusive and complete program through incorporating a natural language processing (NLP) tool that detects the language of a given text.

Challenges: not flexible

Thereâ€™s been an increase in the need for disaster management tools and many of the places that are vulnerable to disasters lack access to resources. Chatbots act as a link between a user and usually a customer service representative or, in the case of my research topic, first responders. I am interested in the implementation of chatbots in different areas and the interaction with users. Due to time constraints, I will mainly focus on the efficiency of the chatbot in answering simple questions and make changes as deemed necessary.
