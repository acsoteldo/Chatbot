# Emergency Chatbot

Basic demo

• Implemented in Python, this is a messaging application that performs live chat functions in response to real-time user interactions during natural disasters.
• Might expand to other languages for a more inclusive and complete program through incorporating a natural language processing (NLP) tool that detects the language of a given text.

The main topic for my research is a chatbot capable of holding a conversation regarding natural disasters. I plan on creating a simple rule-based chatbot. However, I also plan to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) and learn how to train the model to answer simple questions related to specific keywords in order to better understand the logic behind chatbots.

I choose this topic because there’s been an increase in the need for disaster management tools and many of the places that are vulnerable to disasters lack access to resources. Chatbots act as a link between a user and usually a customer service representative or, in the case of my research topic, first responders. I am interested in the implementation of chatbots in different areas and the interaction with users. Due to time constraints, I will mainly focus on the efficiency of the chatbot in answering simple questions and make changes as deemed necessary.
